### Abstract

The **Intelligent Hotel Booking System** is a web-based application designed to simplify and automate the process of searching, booking, and managing hotel reservations. The system provides users with a smart platform to find hotels based on location, price range, availability, and user preferences. By using intelligent features such as recommendation systems and real-time availability updates, the application enhances user experience and decision-making.

The system allows users to:

* Register and log in.

* Search for hotels and view detailed room information.

* Compare prices and make secure online bookings.

**Hotel administrators** can manage hotel details, room availability, pricing, and customer bookings through an admin dashboard. The system also supports automated booking confirmation, cancellation, and payment tracking.

By reducing manual work and improving efficiency, the system benefits both customers and hotel management. It ensures accuracy, transparency, and faster service delivery. This project can be implemented using modern web technologies such as the MERN stack or other full-stack frameworks, making it scalable and user-friendly.
